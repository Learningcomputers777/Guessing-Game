# Guessing-Game
A small game of guesses made by Python

The numbers have a range from 1 to 100 including the boundaries.

Program generates the number in the range given.

Players have to guess the number generated by the program.

If the number is out of bounds it returns out of bounds.

If the number is within 10 of the program number it returns "Warmer".
If the number is away 10 of the program number it returns "Colder".

At last you will be shown in how many guesses you have guessed it.
